# FLIGHT OF THE DODO

## ABOUT

Take full advantage of the oppritunity for immersive interactive story telling to tell the story of a TiZan, a dodo bird, an his longings to take to the skies again like his ancestors long ago. Fully utilize the oppritunities the medium provides -- unifying mechanics, sound, and visual style to work together to create the game's setting (on the island of Mauritius, where the dodo once lived) and story about a flightless bird that wants to fly again.

## GOALS

**Main goals**
- [X] Have a very basic prototype matching the basic outline for our original idea, allowing for rapid testing -- especially swapping around art assets.
- [X] Once we have a very basic prototype to play around with: brain storm design choices and more fine grained concepts.
- [ ] Implement the more complicated mechanics that do a better job telling the story that we're tying to tell.

**Stretch goals**
- [ ] Implement at least one enemy, a cyclone, but possibly others -- other birds, Portuguese sailors, an anthropomorphic pig that's totally not supposed to be a rip off of a particular Looney Toon, or something else thematically appropriate.
- [ ] Better structure the code base with more modular design and work to harden against errors to allow for easier modding for non-programmers or people unfamilar with Python.
